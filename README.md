A Java Swing application to record competitive races times and keep a database file of races results, 
using a MVC architectural pattern and performing CRUD on a CSV file of records. Compile with Java 1.7 or higher.

Features
-------------------
* Races allow registration of a name of the event, the date-time stamp and names of 8 competitors.
* A race can be run without specifying a name ("Default Race" will be used), but not without registering 8 competitors, with form validation rules to enforce it.
* The race clock is shown in a format minutes:seconds,fractionSeconds similarly to real time sports events.
* A race Timer allows to get the individual finish time of every competitor.
* Races results can be saved in a plain CSV file including the names and times of the athletes finishing in the first, second and third place.
* CRUD database operations can be performed on the dynamically indexed CSV file of races records.
* The UPDATE of records is restricted to modifying the race name only to prevent the tampering of sports events results.
